# Hey there I'm Oli Rowe 👋

I am a young innovative individual who loves to challenge the status quo and develop novel solutions to existing problems. Tech enthusiast who loves learning and applying my skills to find the best possible solution.

### Interests 👀

I love ML! Like really love it, the concept is amazing, let statistics write the code and it doesn't **have** to be 100% right, if it is it's most likely wrong 😂

Deep learning is also cool, still a bit of a sceptic though (think it's a little too over-hyped at the moment)

And did I mention that I'm pretty good with python 🤔

Nerd interests aside I'm an avid fisherman 🎣 (whenever I get the chance) and love long walks during the long summer evenings and spending time in the African bushveld 🐘
